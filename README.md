└── README.md             # This file
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run python src/test/TestSuite.py

# Run specific test module
poetry run python src/test/TestSuite.py -m enginetests.UnitTest

# Run with verbose output
poetry run python src/test/TestSuite.py -v
```

### Building Executable

```bash
# Using Poetry script
poetry run galaxywizard-build

# Or directly with PyInstaller
poetry run pyinstaller main.spec --clean

# Output: dist/GalaxyWizard.exe
```

**Note:** The `poetry install` step may fail due to missing C++ build tools for PyOpenGL-accelerate. To build the executable, you'll need to either:
- Install [Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0+ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/), or
- Remove `PyOpenGL_accelerate` from dependencies (it's optional - only provides performance improvements)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev
   ```
3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works
4. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
5. **Submit a pull request** with your improvements
