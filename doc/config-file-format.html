<h1>Config File Format</h1>

Each data file is actually written in the Python language. This is
just done for convenience, as it makes loading the data files a
snap. So it might help to get a text editor that supports Python
syntax highlighting, as it will be easier to notice if you make some
sort of error. Don't think that the data files will be difficult to
write just because we use Python to write them -- all the file formats
have been designed to be easy to edit, even if you have no knowledge
of programming.
<p>
If you are familiar with Python, the format of the data files is
probably immediately obvious to you, and you can skip most of the
details that are here.

<h2>Config file types</h2>

There are a wide variety of things that can be specified in config
files: scenarios, units, classes, abilities, and so on. All the config
files share the same basic format, but when you want to create a
specific type of thing (such as an ability) you'll need to look at the
specific reference for that type of thing to find out the full details
-- such as what sorts of things you need to specify. References for
each type of config file can be found at the bottom of this page.

<h2>Sample config file</h2>

Here's a sample config file. It defines the "Dart" ability. (You can
find the latest version of this file in
<code>data/core/abilities/dart.py</code>.)

<hr>
<pre>
# "Dart" action ability.

VERSION = 1

NAME = "Dart"
DESCRIPTION = "Throw a dart."
COST = 5

ABILITY_TYPE = ACTION
TARGET_TYPE = HOSTILE

RANGE = Circle(1, 4)
AOE = Single()

EFFECTS = [Damage(power=1.25, damageType=PHYSICAL)]

SOUND = 'sword-hit-large'
</pre>
<hr>

<p>
Every type of data file has some number of <i>keys</i> that have
to be given <i>values</i>. Some of these keys are required, and some
are optional. For more information on which keys you need to fill in,
you need to look at the reference for that particular type of data
file. For an ability file, we must specify values for the most of
these keys (such as <code>COST</code> and <code>TARGET_TYPE</code>),
but the <code>SOUND</code> key is optional.
<p>
The basic syntax is <code>SOME_KEY = some_value</code>. The
<code>SOME_KEY</code> needs to start in the first column (all the way to
the left).
<p>
Blank lines are ignored. Any line can contain a comment. Comments
start with a pound sign (<code>#</code>) and continue to the end of
the line. Any text inside a comment is ignored.
<p>
All config files have a <code>VERSION</code> key. This is the version
of the <i>config file format</i>, not the version of the specific
thing you are working on. For now, <code>VERSION</code> should always
be set to <code>1</code>. If we come up with a new file format in the future,
GalaxyMage can use the <code>VERSION</code> numbers to know the
correct way of loading both the old and new files.
<p>
Each value needs to be a specific type. For instance,
<code>COST</code> has to be an integer. Again, the reference for the
specific file type will tell you what kind of value each key
requires. Here's a summary of the various types, and how you write
them:

<ul>

<li>Integer: a whole number. You specify an integer in the obvious
way, like this: <code>2</code>, <code>13</code>, <code>42</code>,
etc. In the example above, the value assigned to <code>COST</code> is
an integer.</li>

<li>Float: a floating-point number (number with a decimal point.) You
specify a float in the obvious way: <code>1.25</code>,
<code>3.0</code>, etc. A float is used in part of the value of the
<code>EFFECTS</code> key.</li>

<li>String: a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. You can use
either single-quotes or double-quotes; there is no difference between
the two. Examples: <code>"Dart"</code>,
<code>'sword-hit-large'</code>. Strings are often used to specify file
names. For instance, the <code>SOUND</code> key is used to specify
which sound file to play when the "dart" action occurs.</li>

<li>List: a list of values, enclosed in square brackets and separated
by commas. Often, the values in the list need to have a certain
type. For instance, a list of integers would look like this: <code>[2,
5, 3, 4]</code>; a list of strings would look like this:
<code>['this', 'is', 'a', 'list']</code>. You can also use parentheses
instead of square brackets: <code>(1, 2, 3, 4)</code>. Like with
strings, there is no difference between using brackets or
parentheses.</li>

<li>Enumerations: sometimes, there are only a couple possible choices
for a value. For instance, there are only 3 valid values for
<code>TARGET_TYPE</code>: <code>HOSTILE</code>, <code>FRIENDLY</code>,
and <code>FRIENDLY_AND_HOSTILE</code>. If a key requires an
enumeration, the reference for the type of data file you are working
on will tell you what values are allowed.</li>

<li>Object: some specific Python object. Objects are similar to
enumerations in that the valid values will be explained in the
reference for the type of data file you are working on. The difference
is that objects can take <i>parameters</i> -- extra values that
provide additional configuration flexibility. This is what
<code>Circle(1, 4)</code> and <code>Single()</code> are -- specific
Python objects that represent a circle with radius 4 and a single
square, respectively.</li>

</ul>
