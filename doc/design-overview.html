<h1>Design Overview</h1>

This page gives a high-level overview of all the major components of a
GalaxyMage campaign. By the time you're done reading this page, you
should have a good understanding of how all the pieces fit
together. After continuing on to learn about the GalaxyMage <a
href="directory-structure.html">directory structure</a> and <a
href="config-file-format.html">config file format</a>, you'll know all
you need to know to start on your own GalaxyMage campaign!

<h2>Campaigns</h2>

A <i>campaign</i> is basically a complete game that uses the
GalaxyMage engine. Right now, GalaxyMage ships with one campaign,
called "demo", that simply has a few demonstration scenarios. In
future releases, we will start to distribute one or more official
campaigns along with GalaxyMage. Right now, true campaigns aren't
implemented yet -- you can't actually string sequences of battles
together in the engine. But that doesn't mean you can't design the
different scenarios now, and use them later.

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

A campaign mostly consists of a group of related
<i>scenarios</i>. Each scenario defines a single battle. Right now, a
scenario file specifies:

<ul>
<li>The <i>map</i> that the battle will take place on.</li>
<li>The <i>units</i> possessed by each <i>faction</i> of the battle.</li>
<li>The <i>ending conditions</i> for the battle.</li>
<li>The <i>lighting</i> and <i>music</i> to use for the battle.</li>
</ul>

Soon, we will add the ability to specify what happens when each ending
condition is satisfied -- that is, you'll be able to actually string
scenarios together into a true campaign. For now, the player's units
and their positions on the field are specified in the scenario
file. Eventually, the player will be able to choose which units he/she
would like to fight with, and place them in an initial region of the
battlefield.

<h2>Maps</h2>

A <i>map</i> is the environment in which a battle occurs. A map can be
used by multiple scenarios, if you would like multiple battles to take
place on the same battlefield. A map file specifies:

<ul>
<li>The width and height of the map.</li>
<li>The height of each map square.</li>
<li>Other attributes for each map square, such as a color, a texture,
and so on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Units</h2>

<i>Units</i> are the actual characters that participate in a
battle. We call them "units" instead of "characters" because the word
"character" is used for many different things in computer programming,
and it's slightly less confusing for developers that way. :) Each unit
includes:

<ul>

<li>A bunch of different <i>stats</i>, which determine the unit's
performance in battle.</li>

<li>A <i>class</i>, which determines (among other things) how the
unit's stats grow when it gains a level, and the abilities available
to the unit. We plan on eventually adding <i>multiclassing</i>, which
will allow a unit to advance in different classes to learn different
sorts of abilities.</li>

<li><i>Abilities</i>, which are different skills that can be used in
combat. The only abilities implemented so far are <i>action
abilities</i>, which are chosen by the player (or AI) as an action
during battle. These abilities are listed under the "Special" menu
option.</li>

<li>A set of sprites, which determine how the unit looks when
displayed on screen.</li>

<li>A gender, which is used to determine what the unit looks like and
to choose a name for the unit. (This is all that gender will ever
affect.)</li>

<li>A name, which is chosen randomly based on the unit's gender.</li>

<li>If the unit is computer-controlled, it contains an <i>AI</i>,
which will choose actions for the unit during battle. Each unit has
its own AI because eventually we will have the ability to create units
with different "personalities" -- some units might be foolhardy, some
might be timid, others might be concerned about keeping their friends
alive, and so on.</li>
</ul>

Eventually, units will have even more things, such as equipment and
weaknesses/strengths to different types of damage, but none of that is
implemented yet.

<h2>Classes</h2>

As mentioned before, every unit has a <i>class</i>. When a unit is
first created, it has an <i>initial class</i>, which determines the
<i>base values</i> of the unit's stats. Every time the unit gains a
level, it chooses a class to level up in -- and its stats grow based
on the <i>growth values</i> specified by the class. Classes also
define a <i>multiplier value</i> for each stat. This will be used once
multiclassing is implemented. For now, you don't have to worry about
it.
<p>
Each class also contains a list of <i>abilities</i>, and how many
levels a unit has to take in that class in order to learn each
ability. So as a unit gains levels in a class, it will learn new
abilities.
<p>
Each class also defines a set of sprites that will be used to display
units that are of that class. These sprites can be overridden on a
per-unit basis, but for most units you'll simply want to use the
default class sprites.

<h2>Abilities</h2>

Right now, the only abilities implemented are <i>action abilities</i>
-- abilities that the player (or AI) can choose as an action during
battle. Eventually there may be other types of abilities. The basic
"Attack" command is also implemented as an action ability. The
specific ability depends on which type of weapon the unit is wielding,
so if the unit is wielding a sword, the "sword" ability will be
used. (Since equipment isn't implemented yet, all "Attack" actions
currently use the "sword" ability.) An ability contains:

<ul>
<li>A name and description, which are displayed to the player.</li>

<li>A <i>cost</i>: the amount of SP required to use the ability. Some
abilities (such as the basic attack abilities) have a cost of 0.</li>

<li>A <i>target type</i>: which targets are affected by the ability. This
can be either FRIENDLY, HOSTILE, or FRIENDLY_AND_HOSTILE.</li>

<li>A <i>range</i>: an area that says where the ability can be
targeted, relative to the unit's current position. There are many
different types of ranges available, including circles, squares, and
crosses.</li>

<li>An <i>area of effect</i>, or <i>AOE</i>: the area around the
targeted area that is also affected by the ability. A simple attack
will usually have an AOE of just the single square that is targeted,
but special attacks can have AOEs or arbitrary shape, including
circles, squares, and crosses.</li>

<li>A list of <i>effects</i>, which determine what happens to each
target that is affected by the ability. Right now, the only types of
effects are damage and healing; later, we will implement various sorts
of status effects.</li>

<li>A sound that is played when the action is initiated.</li>
</ul>

Later, we will add more user-interface fields to the actions, such as
the sound to make when the ability hits a target, some
graphics/animations to use to display the ability as it's used, and so
on.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

Now you know all about the various components of a GalaxyMage
campaign. Before going further, you might want to read about the
GalaxyMage <a href="directory-structure.html">directory structure</a>,
especially about the contents of the <code>data/</code>
directory. Then you can read about the basic GalaxyMage <a
href="config-file-format.html">config file format</a> and get started
writing your own scenarios, maps, abilities, and so on!
