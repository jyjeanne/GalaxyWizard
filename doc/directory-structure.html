<h1>Directory Structure</h1>

This page gives an overview of the directory structure of the
GalaxyMage source tree. 
<p>
If you're interested in designing scenarios,
units, abilities, and so on, you probably only need to read all about
the files in <code>data/</code>. 
<p>
If you intend to develop GalaxyMage code, the files in
<code>src/</code> are probably most important, but you'll probably
also want an idea of how the stuff in <code>data/</code> works.

<h2>./</h2>
The root directory of the GalaxyMage source tree. Contents:
<p>
<code>GalaxyMage.py</code> - the main GalaxyMage script. Imports <code>src/Main.py</code> and executes the <code>main()</code> function defined there.
<p>
<code>*.txt</code> - top-level documentation files.

<h2>data/</h2>

The directory containing all the GalaxyMage data files. This includes
images, sounds, music, and all the configuration files that define
classes, abilities, scenarios, maps, and so on. 

The <code>data/</code> directory has at least three subdirectories:

<h3>data/core</h3>

These are the "core" files that can be used by any GalaxyMage
campaign. This includes the base unit classes, the abilities required
by these classes, unit sprites, fonts, sound effects, and some
plain-text files.

<h3>data/extra</h3>

This contains additional data files that would be part of
<code>data/core/</code>, but are considered "optional". Basically,
this directory is for big data files (such as music) that we might
eventually want to bundle separately, so that players with slow
Internet connections can still download GalaxyMage reasonably quickly.

<h3>data/some-campaign-name</h3>

Every GalaxyMage campaign lives in a separate subdirectory of
<code>data/</code>. A campaign's directory contains the maps,
scenarios, and unit definitions that are used by that campaign. It may
also contain extra class definitions, abilities, sprites, sound
effects, music, and so on, that aren't available in the "core" data
files. GalaxyMage is currently distributed with one campaign, in
<code>data/demo/</code>, that contains a few simple scenarios. If you
want to start on your own campaign, you should start by creating a
separate directory under <code>data/</code>.

<h3>How data files are loaded</h3>

All files in the <code>data/</code> directory are loaded by the code
in the file <code>src/Resources.py</code>. Files are referred to by a
name that contains no subdirectories and no filename extension, such
as "cursor-click". The <code>Resources</code> module takes care of
looking at all the right places to find the file. First, it looks in
the current campaign directory; then, it looks in the
<code>extra</code> directory; finally, it looks in the
<code>core</code> directory. <code>Resources</code> knows what type of
file is being asked for, and uses that to determine which
subdirectories to look in and what filename extension to add. For
instance, sound files need to be in a subdirectory called
<code>sounds</code>, and might end in either <code>.ogg</code> or
<code>.wav</code>. So if the current campaign is called "demo",
<code>Resources</code> will look for the file "cursor-click" in the
following locations:

<pre>
    data/demo/sounds/cursor-click.ogg
    data/demo/sounds/cursor-click.wav
    data/extra/sounds/cursor-click.ogg
    data/extra/sounds/cursor-click.wav
    data/core/sounds/cursor-click.ogg
    data/core/sounds/cursor-click.wav
</pre>

The first file found is the one that will be used. If none of these
paths contains the desired file, an error will occur. This error will
be handled gracefully if it's an optional sort of file, such as a
sound or music file, but much less gracefully if it's something
important, like a class definition or a map file. :)
<p>
I mentioned before that the <code>Resources</code> knows to look in
the <code>sounds</code> subdirectories to find sounds. Here's a list
of all the subdirectories for different types of data files.

<dl>

<dt><code>data/*/abilities</code></dt>
<dd>Files defining abilities that are used by units in battle.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/classes</code></dt>
<dd>Files defining unit classes.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/fonts</code></dt>
<dd>TrueType font files.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/images</code></dt>
<dd>Images. These are mostly unit sprites. All image files are in the
PNG format. Alpha values (translucency) are fully supported by
GalaxyMage.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/maps</code></dt>
<dd>Files defining our 3D battle maps.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/music</code></dt>
<dd>Music files, in <code>.ogg</code> format.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/scenarios</code></dt>
<dd>Files defining scenarios. A scenario tells GalaxyMage all it needs
to know about setting up a battle, including the map name, the units
on each team, the lighting environment, and so on.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/sounds</code></dt>
<dd>Sound effects, in <code>.ogg</code> or <code>.wav</code> format.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/text</code></dt>
<dd>Miscellaneous text files.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/textures</code></dt> 
<dd>Texture files. Like all other images, these are in PNG
format.</dd>

<dt><code>data/*/units</code></dt>
<dd>Files defining the individual units that are used in scenarios.</dd>

<h2>doc/</h2>

All the GalaxyMage documentation is contained here.

<h2>src/</h2>

All the GalaxyMage source code is contained here. Important contents:
<p>
<code>Main.py</code> - The main script. This is what runs when
GalaxyMage is executed. Parses command-line arguments, detects whether
needed libraries are installed, sets up logging, sets up the main
window, and starts the desired scenario.
<p>
<code>Resources.py</code> - This file is the interface for loading all
sorts of data files off the disk. For more information, see the "How
data files are loaded" section above.
<p>
<code>Sound.py</code> - Code for setting up pygame's mixer system and
playing sound effects on various channels.  

<h3>src/ai</h3>

This directory contains all code related to opponent AI.

<h3>src/engine</h3>

This directory contains all code relating to the game engine
itself. Important contents:
<p>
<code>Ability.py, Effect.py, Range.py</code> - These files all deal
with abilities, their ranges, and effects.
<p>
<code>Battle.py</code> - The battle engine itself. Determines the turn
order, notifies the GUI or AI when it's time for the player or
opponent to act, applies movement and action commands, and checks
victory conditions.
<p>
<code>Class.py</code> - This file deals with unit classes.
<p>
<code>Faction.py</code> - Code relating to unit factions -- whether
different units are hostile, friendly, or neutral toward one another.
<p>
<code>Light.py</code> - Defines lights and lighting environments.
<p>
<code>Map.py</code> - Code relating to the battle map, including the
definition of the map itself, breadth-first search on the map,
calculation of movement ranges, calculation of nearest units to a
given point, and so on.
<p>
<code>Name.py</code> - Picks random names for units based on their
genders.
<p>
<code>Scenario.py</code> - Defines scenarios.
<p>
<code>Unit.py</code> - Defines units.

<h3>src/gui</h3>

This directory contains all user-interface code. Importnat files here
include:
<p>
<code>Camera.py</code> - Keeps track of the current camera position
and has some utility functions for calculating stuff based on the
camera position. For instance, it can sort sprites in back-to-front
order so that they are alpha-blended properly.
<p>
<code>Clock.py</code> - Utility code for an FPS clock.
<p>
<code>Cursor.py</code> - Code for moving around the on-screen cursor
-- the blue square on the battle map. This is where the player chooses
where his units move and attack.
<p>
<code>Geometry.py</code> - Utility geometry routines.
<p>
<code>GLUtil.py</code> - Contains a bunch of OpenGL convenience
functions... rendering text to a texture, drawing cubes and sprites on
screen, and so on.
<p>
<code>MainWindow.py</code> - The main window. Contains code for
initializing the pygame/PyOpenGL systems, handling window resize
events, handling some other events, and counting/limiting FPS. The
MainWindow doesn't actually draw anything -- it delegates
responsibility for that to another object, such as ScenarioGUI.
<p>
<code>ScenarioGUI.py</code> - A delegate for displaying an entire
scenario. Draws the map, cursor, unit sprites, battle menus, and so
on.
<p>
<code>Sprite.py</code> - Definitions of sprites, including unit
sprites, on-screen text displayers, and menus.

<h2>tools/</h2>

This directory contains scripts and tools that might be useful to
GalaxyMage developers, but not to players. For example,
<code>tools</code> contains the scripts used to build the Windows and
Macintosh binaries when we do an official release.
